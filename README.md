# Ã‰cole polytechnique | INF581 - Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence | Jesse Read

Academic year: 2018-2019

Teaching coordinators: [Jesse Read](https://jmread.github.io), [Olivier Pietquin](http://www.lifl.fr/~pietquin/), [Nikolaos Tziortziotis](https://ntziortziotis.github.io), [Michalis Vazirgiannis](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Michalis.Vazirgiannis/)

>Due to recent breakthroughs, for example in the area of **robotics** (such as self-driving cars), and **strategic game playing** (such as Go), **artificial intelligence** is experiencing a revival, and is attracting increasing interest from major players in the academic and industrial scene.
>
>An **advanced artificial intelligence** builds on the material presented from Machine Learning I, and thus allows greater freedom to explore advanced topics, since students will have a solid base in **machine learning**, which is a fundamental aspect to much of modern AI.
>
>The following gives an approximate outline of the course. Lectures will cover the **relevant theory**, and labs will familiarize the students with these topics from a **practical point of view**. Two of the lab assignments will be graded, and a team project on reinforcement learning will form a major component of the grade - where the goal is to developing and deploy an agent in an environment and write a report analyzing the results.
>
